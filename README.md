# NHL roster report scraping

## MOTIVATION

My friend Seth and I collect hockey jerseys. If a player is a captain for their team for a game, they wear a C on their jersey, 
and alternate captains wear an A. Sometimes, if the usual captains are not playing in a game (usually from injury), 
a player will wear an A temporarily to fill the role. Seth sometimes likes to get his jerseys customized with a players name and #,
and to make the jersey more unique, get the A on the jersey if the player wore it very little in their time with the team.

To find players who have worn the A in a game, he has had to look at each individual roster report from every game his team (the Dallas Stars)
has played since 2010. This is very time consuming. I heard about what he had been doing and figured there must be a better way.

Through this project, I hope to get this info for every team going back to 2007-2008 so it is available to everyone in this hobby.
