Notes I have on NHL roster reports

- I believe the NHL started having a roster report for every game starting in 2000-2001 (unverified)

- They were not digitized until 2006-2007

- They are all in the same format from 2007-2008 to present day
    - ex: https://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20252026/RO020882.HTM
    - the NHL website game centers only have a link to the roster report from 2010-2011 to present day

- 2006-2007 reports looked different (and presumably back to 2000 but unverified)
    - ex: https://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20062007/RO020171.HTM
    - these are harder

        (SEASON ex:20102011)/(RO for roster)(game type 01:preseason 02:reg season 03:postseason)(#### game number).HTM

    - FOR 03 POSTSEASON:
        4 digit game #: 
        1st 2 digits: round #, 01 for 1st round, 02 for 2nd round, 03 for conf finals, 04 for cup finals
        3rd digit: series #, 1-8 for round 1, 1-4 for round 2, 1-2 for conf finals, onlt 1 for cup finals.
        4th digit: game # of the series (4-7)

    - FOR 01 preseason:
        a lot of random games give a 404 error
