Notes I have on NHL roster reports

- I believe the NHL started having a roster report for every game starting in 2000-2001 (unverified)

- They were not digitized until 2006-2007

- They are all in the same format from 2007-2008 to present day
    - ex: https://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20252026/RO020882.HTM
    - the NHL website game centers only have a link to the roster report from 2010-2011 to present day

- 2006-2007 reports looked different (and presumably back to 2000 but unverified)
    - ex: https://www.nhl.com/scores/htmlreports/20062007/RO020171.HTM
    - these are harder
